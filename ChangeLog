	* Fixed some Gtk5250Terminal resizing bugs, it's now possible to use
	  132 column mode (although it doesn resize smaller again when you
	  go back to 80 column mode yet, hmm...)

	  character.

Sat Nov 20, 1999  Jay 'Eraserhead' Felice <jasonf@nacs.net>
	* autoconf'd and automade
	* Better caching to bitmap (don't draw characters that haven't changed
	  since last draw).
	* Don't use a copied DBuffer as a cache, which saves lots of copies,
	  mallocs, frees, etc.
	* Implemented 'beep' terminal method.
