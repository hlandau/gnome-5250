gnome-5250 TODO
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Complete loading prop dlg controls from config object.
* Implement writing prop dlg control values to config object.
* Implement writing config object to ~/.tn5250rc (in lib5250).
* In tn5250/lib5250, implement `config update callbacks' so that we can
  adjust font, etc., when called.
* Disable prop dlg controls which cannot be changed after connect (when
  connected).
* Move stream type list to top of gtk5250propdlg.c, or expose from lib5250.
  (preferrably the latter).
* Fix pixmap noise at bottom of display (and top).
* Consolidate DEFAULT_FONT #defines.

Behavior should probably be this:
- File | New Session... prompts for name of new session and supplies defaults.
- File | Connect connects to current session.
- File | Disconnect disconnects from current session.
- File | Save Session writes to ~/.tn5250rc
- Session | * is list of sessions (you can select one).
- Auto-connect is a preference (whether to automatically connect to session
  selected from Session menu).  This should be a check box at the top of the
  session menu.
