gnome-5250 BUGS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Funky characters in upper-left part of terminal when we type.  This may now
  be hidden by our update process.
* It seems too unresponsive to me, I should profile the darn thing and see why
  it takes so long to update.  I fear that drawing to the backing store is
  the main reason.
* Under AfterStep, the cursor should turn from solid to an outline and stop
  blinking when the window doesn't have the keyboard focus.  There is no other
  indication.
* Terminal beeps too often.  This is probably a problem with lib5250 we should
  track down.
* No display indicators.
