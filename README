gnome-5250 README
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is Gnome 5250, a front end for the Linux 5250 project's emulator.  The
Linux 5250 emulator package must be installed before this package can be
built.  The homepage for the Linux 5250 project's emulator is
http://tn5250.sourceforge.net/.

You should be able to install this package just by doing the following:

./configure && make && su -c "make install"

If this fails, please drop me a bug report.

Support within this package for a pure GTK+ port which doesn't require Gnome
is in the works.  This should be useful to build on Windows with Tor
Lillqvist's Windows port of GTK+.

Enjoy,
-Jay 'Eraserhead' Felice
